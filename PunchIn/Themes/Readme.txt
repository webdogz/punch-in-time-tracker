This folder is a placeholder for themes and when this is implemented you will be able
to save theme files here in the form of xaml.

For now, you can save an image named "background.jpg" image here that will be loaded 
when the "my-background" theme is chosen.

To choose a theme simply click the settings link at the top of the main window and
select your chosen theme from the Theme menu.
